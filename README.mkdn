# COMMANDS

## help

Displays some help.

## list \[&lt;state>\]

Shows all pull requests in the given state. State can be either `open` or
`closed`.  The default state is `open`.  This is the default command if
none is specified.

## show &lt;number>

Shows details about the specified pull request number. Also includes
comments.

## patch &lt;number>

Shows the patch associated with the specified pull request number.

## checkout &lt;number>

Checks out the specified pull request in a dedicated tracking branch.
If the remote repo is not already specified in your git config, it will be
added and the branch in question will be fetched.

## close &lt;number>

Closes the specified pull request number. Be aware, you can't close a pull
request that has already been merged.  If you try to, you'll get an obscure
`Validation Failed` error message from the GitHub API.

## open &lt;number>

Reopens the specified pull request number. Be aware, you can't reopen a pull
request that has already been merged or closed by the repo owner.  If you
try to, you'll get an obscure `Validation Failed` error message from the
GitHub API.

## comment &lt;number> \[&lt;text>\]

Creates a comment on the specified pull request with the specified text. If
text is not specified, an editor will be opened for you to type in the text.

If your `EDITOR` environment variable has been set, that editor is used to
edit the text.  If it has not been set, it will try to use the [editor(1)](http://man.he.net/man1/editor)
external program.  This is usually a symlink set up by your operating system
to the most recently installed text editor.

The text must be encoded using UTF-8.

## login \[&lt;user>\] \[&lt;password>\] \[<2fa-token>\]

DEPRECATED: Logs you in to GitHub and creates a new access token used
instead of your password and two-factor authentication token. If you don't
specify either of the options, they are looked up in your git config github
section. If none of those are found, you'll be prompted for them.

## authorize \[&lt;access-token>\]

Logs you in to GitHub by manually creating an OAuth personal access token.
Follow the directions on-screen to generate one and insert it when prompted.
If you already have an access token you want to use you can also specify it
on the command line.

# METHODS

## new

Constructor. Takes no parameters.

## run(@args)

Calls any of the other listed public methods with specified arguments. This
is usually called automatically when you invoke [git-pr](https://metacpan.org/pod/git-pr).

# DEBUGGING

Set the environment variable GIT\_PR\_DEBUG to a non-zero value to see more
details, like each API command being executed.

If you want to interact with another GitHub repo than the one in your
current directory, set the environment variable GITHUB\_REPO to the name of
the repo in question. Example:

    GITHUB_REPO=robinsmidsrod/App-GitHubPullRequest git pr list

Be aware, that if that repo is a fork, the program will look for its parent.

# CAVEATS

If you don't authenticate with GitHub using the authorize command, it will use
unauthenticated API requests where possible, which has a rate-limit of 60
requests.  If you authorize first it should allow 5000 requests before you hit
the limit.

You must be standing in a directory that is a git dir and that directory must
have a remote that points to github.com for the tool to work.
