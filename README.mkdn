# COMMANDS

## list \[<state>\]

`closed`.  The default state is `open`.  This is the default command if
none is specified.

## show <number>

comments.

## patch <number>

Shows the patch associated with the specified pull request number.

## close <number>

Closes the specified pull request number.

## open <number>

# METHODS

## run(@args)

Calls any of the other listed public methods with specified arguments. This
is usually called automatically when you invoke [prq](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?prq).

# CAVEATS

If you don't have `git config github.user` and `git config github.password`
set in your git config, it will use unauthenticated API requests, which has
a rate-limit of 60 requests. If you add your user + password info it should
allow 5000 requests before you hit the limit.

You must be standing in a directory that is a git dir and that directory must
have a remote that points to github.com for the tool to work.
