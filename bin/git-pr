The following external programs are required:

=for :list

=head1 CAVEATS

If you don't authenticate with GitHub using the login command, it will use
unauthenticated API requests where possible, which has a rate-limit of 60
requests.  If you login first it should allow 5000 requests before you hit
the limit.

You must be standing in a directory that is a git dir and that directory must
have a remote that points to github.com for the tool to work.
